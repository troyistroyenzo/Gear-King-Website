<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	
	<p>&nbsp;Gear King is a small retailing business based in the Philippines. It was first found by Troy, 
		a young student from the university of Mapua. For around 10 years, 
		Troy has been pursuing photography as a hobby while pursuing to become computer science. 
		In order to fund his computer science tech needs, he has heavily invested his capital in hard selling and retailing.
It all started in the summer of 2015 when I got first into photography. I loved capturing the simplest sceneries and objects at home. I got so passionate that I started doing commissions for free. I've done around 50+ shoots until I was recommended to start charging. Around 2017, my skills got me to higher places–– I started earning from my passion. It wasn't till 2018 where I was earning enough to start investing in new camera equipment. It was indeed the beginning of the journey.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;Around December 2019, my mentor introduced me to the professional industry, 
		where I was heavily greeted by many contractors looking for young freelancers to help them further their vision. 
		I got in touch with many camera companies, and they wanted to help me grow a small business retailing camera equipment.
		Up to this day, I still continue to pursue photography/videography as a main "sport."</p>
	
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	
	<h2>What made you get into photography?</h2>
	
	<p>&nbsp;Passion. Art. If you love a hobby, you'll learn to love getting into the nitty-gritty of the things. 
		When I was younger, I basically had zero experience with a camera. But it was my taste and curiosity 
		that furthered my skill and craft in photography. Who knew that one day my passion for such would branch 
		out into videography. It's indeed a surreal experience learning new things from that which you love.</p>
	
	<h2>&nbsp;What made you get into the retailing industry?</h2>
	
	<p>&nbsp;I want other hobbyists or professionals to acquire great gear at low costs. 
		My specific connections with my suppliers give me virtually unlimited access to a myriad of gear, 
		and I am given the liberty to resell these products at my desired price. I am fully aware that not everyone can acquire such,
		and that is why I am finding ways to always keep my prices down without compromising on quality and integrity. </p>
	
	<h2>Do you have any advice to younger entrepreneurs?</h2>
	
	<p>&nbsp;PURSUE YOUR PASSION. Not everything will be easy, but COMMITMENT, TIME, EFFORT, 
		and MANAGEMENT are key players in achieving a goal. 
		I never thought I'd get to where I was if it weren't for the fact that one thing was keeping me going: 
		having the end in mind. It isn't the momentary sacrifice that will make the difference, 
		but it's that momentary sacrifice that will echo in the future. Indeed, a man reaps what he sows. 
		If I invest in time, skill, relationships, and opportunities–– the reap will ripe and overflowing with rewards. 
		Choose your battles wisely!</p>
	
	<h2>How do I get better in my hobby? Specifically multimedia</h2>
	
	<p>&nbsp;Like I said before, PASSION IS EVERYTHING. But for me, I have also devised a method for getting better into three parts:
		The none-creative
		The creative
		The application
		The none-creative more or less focuses on theory. Knowing photoshop, premiere, 
		and lightroom; it's basically getting to know your tools. Just as a carpenter is very familiar with his tools, 
		an aspiring multimedia man must know his gear. Getting down the basic settings, understanding the user interface, 
		understanding lighting, understanding composition, etc. are just some things that you need to understand before you 
		jump into something.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;The creative deals with the right side of the brain–– the creative side. 
		Think of the none-creative as the more logical, whereas in the creative, you are utilizing your imagination 
		and experience to shape your craft. This factor actually determines the output of your work, 
		wherein your work truly defines you. It helps create that identity in your work when people say 
		that a certain work looks like certain artist's style–– that's their fingerprint written on it! 
		Developing creativity is innate, it cannot be taught or learned, it can be refined and polished–– but you solely define it.</p>
	
	<h2>What gear do you use?</h2>
	
	<p>&nbspI"ve been using the same gear since 2016. Although I have access to almost gear I want, I'd like to make it a point that gear is not
	the key to getting better, but the handler of that gear. Many people ask my why I don't upgrade my gear, well I simply think that
	I'd rather invest in skill, something intangiable, as compated to something that can depreciate overtime. Until I see a time
	where I think a renewal of gear is necessar, I'm sticking with my old gold. </p>
